Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings.\n\nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.\n\nThe Dark Lord has risen, and as he unleashes hordes of Orcs to conquer all Middle-earth, Frodo and Sam struggle deep into his realm in Mordor.\n\nTo defeat Sauron, the One Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. But the way is impossibly hard, and Frodo is weakening. The Ring corrupts all who bear it and Frodo’s time is running out.\n\nWill Sam and Frodo succeed, or will the Dark Lord rule Middle-earth once more?",
